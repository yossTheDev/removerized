    🛑 Project Status: Open Source Version Discontinued
    This Open Source version of the project will no longer be maintained due to licensing restrictions imposed by (@imgly/background-removal), which is released under the AGPL license.

    Since we plan to transition this project into a SaaS product, we will be replacing this library with an alternative solution that allows for a more flexible licensing model.

    We appreciate the support from the community, and we will share updates on the new version as development progresses. Stay tuned! 🚀
